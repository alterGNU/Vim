## ðŸ“ƒ Resume
- **Pb**    : I have multiple windows and I want to name and display this topic name on the windows as a Title.
- **Sol**   : enable "Use system title bar and borders" AND name every open window after their topic.

## ðŸš§ Problem
When browsing, I often organize my web researches by topic : one theme per window.

Grouping my tabs by topics is quite practical:
- I can easily change topic by switching windows using the shortcut : `[Alt]+[Tab]`
- I can 'save' these windows in my favorite bar as a single folder with the shortcut : `[CTRL]+[Maj]+[D]`

But I often get the wrong window when navigating throw...

## âœ… Solution
_(This Solution seems to been enable only for linux)_

- 1 | Enable the option "Use system title bar and borders"
    - right click one the area nest to the symbole (where tabs names are display)
    - in the menu, check the option "Use system title bar and borders"
- 2 | Name every window open
    - right click one the area nest to the symbole (where tabs names are display)
    - in the menu, click on "Name window..."
    - in the pop-up named, "Name this window" enter your title.

Now every windows can be name after their topic.
